Github actions demo 

GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. Hereâ€™s what each part of the code does:

    name: GitHub Actions Demo: This is the name of the workflow.
    on: [push]: This workflow gets triggered when a push event occurs on any branch of the repository.
    jobs:: This section contains a list of jobs. Jobs are run in parallel by default.
    Explore-GitHub-Actions:: This is the identifier for the job.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest: This specifies that the job will run on an Ubuntu runner. ubuntu-latest refers to the latest Ubuntu version.
    steps:: Steps are a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
Each - run: line is a step that executes a command on the runner. In this case, they are mostly echoing information about the workflow run:

    The first run step echoes the event that triggered the workflow.
    The second run step echoes the type of server the job is running on.
    The third run step echoes the name of the branch and the repository where the workflow is running.
    The Check out repository code step uses the actions/checkout@v4 action to clone the repository code to the runner.
    The next run step confirms that the repository has been cloned to the runner.
    The following run step indicates that the workflow is ready to test the code.
    The List files in the repository step lists all the files in the current workspace of the repository.
    The final run step echoes the status of the job.
